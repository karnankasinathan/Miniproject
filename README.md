## Toxic or Non-Toxic Plant Identification Using CNN
Identifying whether a plant is toxic or non-toxic is vital tion.for public health, agriculture, and environmental safety. This project utilizes CNNs to develop a highly accurate model for classifying plants as toxic or non-toxic, improving the accessibility and precision of plant identification

## About
Machine learning and deep learning to address plant safety by identifying toxic and non-toxic plants. By training models like CNN,  VGG16 on a well-structured dataset, the project provides a user-friendly tool for plant identification, aiming to raise awareness about plant toxicity. This application not only helps in individual plant identification by image or name search but also introduces an innovative camera-based feature to enable real-time recognition. This blend of practical use and advanced modeling has potential applications in botany, public safety, and environmental education, supporting users in making informed decisions about plants in their surroundings.



## Features

Image-Based Toxicity Detection: Users can upload a plant image, and the app will predict whether it is toxic or non-toxic using trained models.

Name-Based Plant Search: Users can input a plant’s name to check its toxicity status, making it easy to get information without needing an image.

## Requirements

High-Performance GPU: For training complex deep learning models like ResNet, DarkNet, and VGG16 (especially during development).
Plant Toxicity Dataset: A well-labeled dataset containing images of toxic and non-toxic plants (e.g., 5,000 images each as per your current dataset).
Python (with Libraries): Key libraries include TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (for prototyping), or PyCharm.
Web Frameworks (for Web Application): Flask or Django, if deploying as a web application.

## Results and Impact

plant toxicity identification project aims to provide reliable, real-time plant classification, accurately identifying plants as toxic or non-toxic through advanced models like CNN, ResNet, and VGG16. With both image upload and camera-based detection, users can easily assess plant safety on the go, whether by uploading a photo or scanning with their camera. This accessible, user-friendly tool enhances public safety by helping people avoid harmful plants, making it useful for outdoor enthusiasts, gardeners, and healthcare providers alike. Additionally, the app serves as an educational resource, supporting awareness and safety in fields such as agriculture and environmental science. In the long term, it offers broad applications, empowering users to make informed decisions about the plants they encounter daily.
